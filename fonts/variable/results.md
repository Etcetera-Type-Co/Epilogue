<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.
If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font Bakery
could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure call
(rpc).
There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/main/prebuilt/workarounds
/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** Could not find ftxvalidator. [code: ftxvalidator-available]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Ensure variable fonts include an avar table.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/mandatory_avar_table](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/mandatory_avar_table)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Most variable fonts should include an avar table to correctly define axes
progression rates.
For example, a weight axis from 0% to 100% doesn&#x27;t map directly to 100 to 1000,
because a 10% progression from 0% may be too much to define the 200, while 90%
may be too little to define the 900.
If the progression rates of axes is linear, this check can be ignored. Fontmake
will also skip adding an avar table if the progression rates are linear.
However, we still recommend designers visually proof each instance is at the
desired weight, width etc.</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** This variable font does not have an avar table. [code: missing-avar]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Check glyphs do not have components which are themselves components.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/glyf_nested_components](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/glyf.html#com.google.fonts/check/glyf_nested_components)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
There have been bugs rendering variable fonts with nested components.
Additionally, some static fonts with nested components have been reported to
have rendering and printing issues.
For more info, see:
* https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/2961
* https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive/issues/412</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** The following glyphs have components which themselves are component glyphs:
	* uni01EF
	* iogonek
	* uni01C6.sc
	* onehalf
	* onehalf
	* onequarter
	* onequarter
	* threequarters

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?</summary>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:
	- f + f
	- f + i
	- i + f
	- f + l
	- l + f

* [com.google.fonts/check/stylisticset_description](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/stylisticset_description)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Stylistic sets should provide description text. Programs such as InDesign,
TextEdit and Inkscape use that info to display to the users so that they know
what a given stylistic set offers.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The stylistic set ss01 lacks a description string on the 'name' table. [code: missing-description]
